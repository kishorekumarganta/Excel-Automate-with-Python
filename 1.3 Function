Function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

We can Pass Data known as "Parameters" in to a Function ==> Functions Returns Data as a Result



def add_one(num):
  return num+1
  
def write_to_excel(table):
  excel.write(table)
  
def average_of_two_numbers(num1,num2):
  return (num1+num2)/2
  



Library= A file or Multiple Files containing a set of Functions that we wanna include in our application.


Libraries provide specialized functions for any needs.

Thousands of opensource libraries


Few Imp. for us are:

openpyxl, xlsxwriter ==> Help us to Read/write  into/From an excel file.
numpy for performing stats
pandas = vlookup,pivots etc
matplotlib = for visualizing


pypi.org is the place where find.
pip install "library name"
just import to use.
