## Get started

### First use

The section below is required for first use only.

1. Create an environment of work with `py -m venv venv`
1. Activate the environment `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
1. Install dependencies
    1. `pip install pandas`
    1. `pip install xlsxwriter`
    1. `pip install openpyxl`
    1. `pip install numpy`
    1. `pip install matplotlib`

Note: Creating an environment ensures that all the libraries installed will stay only inside this environment. If someone else or another project needs other libraries this will no affect this project, they will be able to do so withing their own environment.

### Regular use

For any use of those scripts, follow the steps below:

1. Activate the environment created before
    1. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
    1. `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
1. Launch your script with `py path\to\main_script.py`
